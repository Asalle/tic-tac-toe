# Simple tic-tac-toe game
with an eastern egg for my friends

## How to start
### Windows:
Down load the .zip archive with binary (not the source code), there should be tic-tac-toe.exe and some dynamic libs.
Run the exe file. And you're done!

### Linux
To be done, but you can always just clone the repo, install the love2d and run `love path/to/tic-tac-toe`

### Tests
Running tests is available on linux only so far. Run `love path/to/tic-tac-toe --test`.
